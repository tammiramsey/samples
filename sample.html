        <h3>Reading has always been a source of comfort and escape for me</h3>
        <!--insert a picture of books here-->
        <p>
            I have been an avid reader since childhood. It all started when 
            my dad and I would read the Sunday comics together. Short, 
            colorful stories captured my imagination. From there, I became a 
            voracious reader. It was routine that I would walk home from the 
            local library with a stack of books that I would consume within 
            a week's time. As a student, I would always have a book with me 
            to read when I finished my classwork. While in high school, 
            there were summers where I would read over 100 books! Now as an 
            adult, I have an annual goal of reading 35 books, which I feel 
            is a modest and achieveable goal. In 2020, after the world shut 
            down, I modified my goal of 35 books to 50, and ended up reading 
            69 books! In 2021, between returning to teaching in-person and 
            welcoming my second child into the world, I kept my goal at 35 
            books and ended up reading 38. Between being a wife, mother, 
            friend, volunteer, teacher, and student, I feel like 35 is 
            something very doable.

            What I love most about books is that I have the 
            opportunity to learn something new, or escape into 
            another world.. I usually read historical works, both 
            fiction and non-fiction. Because of this love of history 
            and reading, working on two degrees in history felt like 
            pleasure more often than work. Over the past few years, I 
            have expanded my reading to include more non-history 
            subjects. My coworkers and fellow-book nerds have 
            introduced me to romance novels, and with the pandemic I 
            found these to be the perfect escape.
